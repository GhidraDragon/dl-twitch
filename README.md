Jassy go pay anyone Twitch to fix this severe security flaw it's impossible ... üëå‚úãüëçüëçüëçüëç

Responsibly disclosing Twitch Security practices to Amazon - ok - I hope your percentage of H1B hires isn't too much greater than 15% per year, because if it's maybe 40%? 10k new visas approved / 15% total headcount?? or / 40% totol headcount for the SAME JOB TITLES or similar enough


-----

Because after you hit the 15% rough limit let's go with 20% Mr Andy Jassy - how about another email from Amazon HR? - by a 2005 added guidance I think, you're required to perform this loop for every += 1 H1B visa you APPLY for. APPLY

NOTE: Donny's Jan 2025 something I believe replaced I'm not sure whether legally or not the below paste, but it essentially says the same thing - https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/62o-h1b-recruitment



H-1B-dependent employers must also make a good-faith effort to recruit U.S. workers for the position by deploying industry-wide standards before hiring an H-1B worker. The employer must recruit potential U.S. workers for the position through advertising, job fairs, and other standard forms of recruitment. Moreover, employers must offer the job to any equally or better qualified U.S. worker who applies for the position, and are prohibited from favoring current nonimmigrant employees who have not yet obtained H-1B status (e.g., students currently working under an Optional Practical Training (OPT) program).


Here's a "Department of Labor" site https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs62O.pdf - I am sorry Donald the Chinese have no crediblity 

An employer must recruit in ‚Äúgood faith.‚Äù What does this mean?
An employer which recruits in good faith must offer fair and nondiscriminatory opportunities for employment
to U.S. workers. U.S. workers must be given fair consideration for jobs. H-1B workers must not be favored
over U.S. workers. 


Must U.S. workers be offered jobs for which H-1B workers are sought?
Yes. U.S. applicants must be offered such jobs in some circumstances. If the employer is H-1B dependent
(see WH Fact Sheet #62C) or a willful violator of H-1B requirements (see WH Fact Sheet #62S), a U.S.
worker who applies for a job for which an H-1B worker is sought must be offered the job if he/she is
equally or better qualified than the H-1B applicant. These requirements also apply to an employer receiving
funding described in EAWA who hires a new H-1B worker during the period Feb. 17, 2009 to Feb. 16, 2011
(See WH Fact Sheet 62Z).

Anyways dev.twitch.tv allows signatory accounts to gerenate what I label an "API key" for full access that does not require any other accounts to authenticate my "API key"

So  what's this? Test of concept ML? I got everything in all threads, got emails for fun using tesseract then regex, spammed all the streamers literally the ones who put email in chromedriver. 

I've never seen an RECAPTCHA-like machine intelligent safety system deployed at Twitch in my life.

NOTE: if this doesn't work, you need to add your own client-id and bearer token. You could do it with the --client-id and --authorization command line arguments, or just change the default client_id and auth lines.

You get your client-id and access tokens here: https://twitchtokengenerator.com/

    else:
        #auth = 'Bearer 34o73hb40ag2g50sz38wjgyb1rjpmw'
        auth = 'Bearer kkm7qh0sgokps8vgt4xtwk32994x9r'
    if client_id:
        client_id = client_id
    else:
        #client_id = '43zeiffzo1vaceatiyp58fzbynqhlq'
        client_id = 'gp762nuuoqcoxypju8c569th9wz7q5'

Pre-requisites: python(3), selenium, and Google Chrome (or for testing or whatever works with chromedriver) + chromedriver

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (use wget rather than curl -O or whatever... same i think..... wget is a wrapper and a parser....)

also yt-dlp (use pip install or brew install or apt install or choco or rpm or whatever) and ffmpeg (same) if you want to download videos. can't include ffmpeg in requirements.txt unless i write it PURELY in python or cpython.. :(((( 


---

Usage: python (or python3) dl_twitch.py user_name1 user_name2 etc.

Video of sample usage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SelWmJm2Stg

6/23/2023 UPDATE: I think they actually broke their own API to stop the gathering of gambling streamers and their content. I don't see any bugs in my code, but there's always the possibility. Right now their API ignores the game_id parameter for get streams so it just gets everyone. Right now I'll display a temporary archive of mostly-illegal casino streamers promoting their own referral links at the very least, but I plan to get their whole data for "larger" streamers anyways: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/luy0xux3xalp2k8/AABSzu2rWqJT0mHdzEkxoOAja?dl=0

Illegal gambling streamers specific usage:

Specific usage: python dl_twitch.py --games casino -NV (grabs metadata and screenshots for all the casino and poker streamers, including slots, blackjack, etc)

Specific usage 2: python dl_twitch.py --games casino (also downloads videos in 480p for all casino and poker streamers)

Experimental: sh gamblers_autorun.sh (this shouldn't crash your filesystem compared to autorun.sh because there's only 100-200 gambling streams on Twitch at once, but it's still experimental)

Sample Dropbox links displaying gambling stream screenshots: 

1) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9fsnvn7auwiijo5/AADgknLY1NJM_iHRHZyUJLuUa?dl=0

2) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jx76dse4ex4z9xp/AABB2D-D0FgTAf7250oTpvaoa?dl=0

---

Arguments: python dl_twitch.py --games (to get specific games that string match) -NV (no videos to downlaod) -TS (get top streamers information) --pages (specify how many pages * 100 streamers you want to download; replaces the -TS flag) -NS (no screenshots) -STAFF (get Twitch staff data)

Additional arguments: python dl_twitch.py -h

Experimental: sh autorun.sh (this may crash filesystem after grabbing screenshots and running for a long time; may need to append screenshots together to not crash)

To detect illegal gambling streamers static algorithms may be sufficient, but the idea is to start designing a general purpose algorithm that detects dangerous or illegal activities on the Internet. The possibilities of how to do this is endless, and I don't think adding random layers to all the raw data will work well. I think you need much more targeted design principles, but I think you definitely can train useful models with proper design.
